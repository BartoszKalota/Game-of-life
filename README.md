# Information
It is so called zero-player game that evolves on the basis of its original state ([more information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)).<br />

To start the game you need to provide the size of the board in a prompt. The optimal number is ranging from 10 to 100. **If the prompt does not appear, refresh the page**.

Below the board, there are buttons controlling the game.<br />
Initially, there is a 'glider' on the board. Click Play to see what will happen.<br />
You can also modify the state of any cell on the board anytime. To do so, click the Pause button. Next, click any cell on the board to handle its state or press the mouse key, hold it, and move the cursor on the board to modify many cells at once. Then, click Play.

This project uses JavaScript in ES5 standard. The ES6 standard is utilized in projects including at least Workshop-4 in their titles.
